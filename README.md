taken me a year ish
use the numeric updown and set a amount of time to display for
select a single photo or gif on the open file dialog
and keep selecting till you have the amount you want
then press EXECUTE this starts the system off
if you already had photos on there dont worry it will execute the timer automatically
if you want to pause well. the pause button is self explanetory
the delete button will delet the last one added aswell as its timing

future updates 1.02: plan to add your desktop icons over the background  i also plan to have it start on os startup allowing you more conveiniece for now until i can get it firing
